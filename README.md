# Example Project

Library for a blob detection GUI I created for various applications within my field. This GUI allows the user to 
find a "blob" using their preferred camera (webcam by default). The "blobs" can then be mark and the deviation from 
one detection to another can be recorded to a CSV.

## Getting Started
