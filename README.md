# Example Project

Library for the Soup project blob detection and GUI. Note, I have not included the img_processing script in order to protect our detection algorithm.

## Getting started

```pip install support\arena_api-2.3.3-py3-none-any.whl```

Next, use the setup.py to set up your environment. This can be done either through your IDE or with the following:
```python setup.py install```

Finally, move the "lab_instruments" folder into your environment's \Lib\site-packages folder.

## Included batch script

The included batch script can be used to call the main script from a pseudo-executable. This can be done by creating a 
shortcut program to the .bat file. Under "Properties", this shortcut can be changed to run as a minimized window, and 
its icon can be changed to whatever is preferred (an .ico is also included).
